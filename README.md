# WeatherChatBot
This an IRC bot from scratch using java that will give the  weather information of any U.S city via zip code/city and state name.
The bot fetches the JSON from www.openweathermap.org using RESTful API, where the relative information is then parsed, returning the name and temperature of the city in Fahrenheit. The chatbot will also return the type of weather for the day.
Along with getting weather information, the chatbot is able to give the relative allergy/pollen levels of the specified city utilitzing the Weatherbit API (with a free trial). 
If you are looking to replicate, a new trial for Weatherbit will be required.
